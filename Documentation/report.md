# All Set — Wallpaper Library: report

Read only the CURRENT STATE block at the start of a session. HISTORY is a terse
log; it never needs reading in full.

---

_(latest local checkpoint: 2026-10-05, Themes toolbar and smoothness; full log in Reports/2026-10-05-themes-toolbar-smoothness.md)_

### 2026-10-05 — toolbar refinement (local, not committed or pushed)
- Single compact filter/search surface; narrow category menu; fixed toolbar replaces pinned-header layout.
- Per-image cache observation, two adjacent desktop previews prepared ahead, search focus preserved when the hero returns.
- 312 tests / 85 suites and 30 native carousel/cache checks pass. Four window sizes verified; exact signed Dock app replaced and relaunched on Themes.
- Interleaved comparison: mean app CPU 47.2% → 43.1% (~9% lower); p95 20.6–25.1 → 18.2–20.2 ms; zero >33 ms hitches. System-wide WindowServer sample slightly higher, no GPU/WindowServer improvement claim.
- Previous cinematic app backed up. Full logs/captures in `build/review/themes-refinement/`.


### 2026-10-05 — cinematic Themes design (local, not committed or pushed)
- Approved mockup implemented: landscape desktop spotlight, portrait neighbours, pinned filters/search, centered actions, Trending cards, Moodboards and responsive shelves.
- Original offline Midnight Aurora artwork and 12-widget theme; packaged into the exact signed Dock app at `build/AllSet.app`, running on Themes.
- 312 tests in 85 suites pass; 27 native carousel checks pass; debug/release warning checks pass; four window sizes rendered. Actual Dock app screenshot saved in `build/review/selected-design/dock-app-themes.png`.
- New optimized scroll: 29–31% app CPU, p95 18.4–19.5 ms, no hitches; WindowServer whole-run sample 41.6%, includes other apps. No GPU utilization claim or comparable HEAD speedup claim.
- Previous bundle backed up. Other tabs and backend changes await the user's next request.

Previous checkpoints:

### 2026-10-05 (pushed to cloud main and perf-audit `d6c4512`, 313 tests, 0 warnings)
- Themes hero redesign through H2 (see HANDOFF "Current state (2026-10-05)" and docs/UI-Spec.md). Next: H3 card lighting, on the user's go-ahead.
- Open: atmosphere +5 points scroll CPU (42-43% vs 37-38%), flattening test not run.

### 2026-10-03 wrap-up (details in Reports/2026-10-03-wrap-up.md)

### 2026-10-03 later (pushed to cloud main and perf-audit, 293 tests, 0 warnings)
- Home, Collections and Art pages removed; Desktop opens on Themes; art stays as the Wallpaper page's Art source. The overnight redesign (`redesign/ui`) was not taken and stays local.
- Theme previews: saving one no longer deletes other builds' cached previews (debug runs were wiping the Dock app's cache, so Themes redrew everything); photos and forecasts are fetched in parallel, only drawing is serial.
- Fixed from the app's error log: duplicate ForEach ids (music widget), cancelled-screenshot file read, preview-cache misses, Core Audio listener removal on gone devices.
- `Deferred` below-the-fold building (worst switch frame Themes ~110→70 ms, Wallpaper ~90→70); aerial previews, clipboard and My Photos thumbnails decode off main, cached. See Reports/2026-10-03-wrap-up.md.
- Open: Gallery scroll hitches, ~100 ms Island/Gallery switches.

### 2026-10-03 (earlier)
- Page switches 330-990 ms -> 45-106 ms held (`PageVeil` Core Animation fade, no SwiftUI cross-fade); Gallery is flat exact-height rows; `PageScaffold` lazy.
- Grid is quarter cells; swap-on-drop; per-display widget size (`screenFits`) with refit on resolution/monitor change; themes spread to the screen's edges.
- Themes banner = active theme (`activeThemeSet`), Turn Off Theme (undoable); Liquid Glass tabs (not yet seen live); disk/energy rates fixed after idle gaps.
- Aerial Videos stays its own tab (a move into My Videos was tried and reverted).
- Not yet seen by a person: glass tabs, a second-monitor switch, swap-on-drop.

### Earlier (2026-10-02)

### Working right now (verified only)
- **Wallpaper library: unchanged** since the 2026-10-01 docs sync (sizes, detail sheet,
  Owned filter, two deletes, server fetch/offload, redesign). Not yet seen by a person:
  the Touch ID prompt, and the redesigned Library with real wallpapers.
- **Widgets** (`4dec6f5`, `5cb9353`): snap grid, drag to a free slot, gallery drag-to-desktop,
  right-click menu; "From Themes" gallery (623 widgets, 57 themes); per-widget font, letters,
  corners, renamed built-in words and a caption below. Verified in the real app (tidy, Arrange
  drag, right-click, Remove) and offscreen renders. **Not yet seen by a person:** dragging a
  gallery card onto the desktop, and dragging a widget off the desktop outside Arrange mode.
- **Lid Plane** (`0626efc`): System → Lid Plane. Renderer checks pass, page renders with the
  live hinge reading. **Not tried:** a live capture with the effect on.
- **AI Screenshot shortcut** (`bf59f1f`): Off / ⌘⇧5 / ⌃⌥⌘5; ⌘⇧5 switches macOS's own off and
  restores it on quit. Verified in the real app with injected key presses. The user's Mac is set to ⌘⇧5.
- 263 tests, 0 warnings. **Nothing from 2026-10-02 is pushed** (3 commits ahead of `cloud/main`).
- Outside the repo: Claude Code now has the ponytail plugin enabled by default and a `/extension`
  command (`~/.claude/commands/extension.md`, `~/.claude/ponytail-ctl.js`); needs a new session.

### Known issues / blockers
- `delete_service.py` isn't a launchd service; ~700 older wallpapers lack the crossfade fix;
  no settings UI for the server URL; deleting the active wallpaper leaves it pointing at nothing.
- Gallery scroll has hitches (7-19 over 13,000 pt, 52-58% CPU), predating this work.

### Next step
The user's 7-step list: **4** analyse this Mac (hardware, sensors, permissions) and adapt;
**5** measure and fix choppiness everywhere (gallery scroll first); **6** window UI toward the
"Wallspace" reference; **7** Island Notes tab with alarms, stopwatch and daily routine reminders.

## DRIFT AUDIT — 2026-09-27
Code checked against `architecture.md`, section by section.
- Library folders, catalog and resolution rule: **match.**
- `originals/` reuse and orphan cleanup: **match.**
- **One mismatch:** `HANDOFF.md` still said videos play from the drive.
  Chose to **fix the doc to match the code**, since the code is verified.
Result: no code changes needed; docs now agree with reality.

## HISTORY
- Wallpaper library: importer, catalog, playback — 48 videos imported — `5b54296`
- Wallpaper library: gallery, scale probe, no-regression checks — `7608ad4`
- Handoff and session report for the import — `1e633b1`
- Scenes and web wallpapers imported (181 total, 75 live/106 stills) — `5704a87`
- Scene stills rendered as moving loops (138 live/43 stills) — `f4c2072`
- Self-contained library; survives the source folder being deleted — `30e2479`
- Phase-1 dataset (239 items) merged; cross-root dedup fixed; 408 total, self-containment reverified with both source folders absent — 29f75a4
- Scene renderer diagnosis: pipeline invents motion and drops masks, keyframes, sprites, tints; options A/B/C awaiting decision — see scene-renderer-diagnosis.md — diagnosis only, no code change
- Scenes rendered with their own shipped shaders (wescene.swift); 409 total (318 live/91 stills); dataset folder deleted after verified self-containment — pending commit
- Third dataset (all_set_mac, 516 new items) merged; 776 total (597 live/179 stills); 23 items auto-upgraded to the shader renderer; drive unmounted+remounted to prove independence — pending commit
- Particles, refraction, keyframe offsets, multi-pass geometry fixed; 24 duplicates removed; 753 total (608 live/145 stills) — pending commit
- Core bug found and fixed: loop crossfade blended the head toward a
  mismatched future frame instead of easing the tail into the true head,
  causing a white/colour flash at the start of every replay on scenes whose
  content doesn't fit the loop exactly. Confirmed on 49/321 scene loops by
  direct measurement. Fix compiled; re-render needs the drive (unmounted at
  time of fix) reconnected — not yet re-verified against real output.
- Added a manual delete button (top-right, on hover, with a confirm step) to
  each Library tile: permanently deletes this Mac's own copies, records the
  id in removed.json so re-imports never bring it back, and edits catalog.json
  as raw JSON (not through the app's narrower model) so other wallpapers'
  importer-only fields (sha256, sceneNotes...) survive untouched. New test
  proves both the permanence and the no-data-loss property. 207 tests pass,
  0 warnings, app rebuilt.
- Fourth source folder merged (all_set_mac, new drive "Nithin J", 465 new
  wallpapers); 1178 total (1008 live/170 stills); delete-button removal
  verified against real duplicate content; crossfade fix confirmed applying
  to new renders, pre-existing library still needs it — pending commit
- R1 gap fixed: a workshop item with no video and no scene package (pure
  interactive HTML/JS wallpapers) vanished with no reason logged anywhere.
  Found by checking "is everything from the pendrive actually there" against
  the raw folder, not assumed. Now every non-scene item either imports or
  gets a skip reason; 10 previously-silent items on the current dataset now
  correctly recorded as unsupported (interactive wallpapers, a documented
  non-goal) — pending commit
- Quality pass on the fourth dataset: R1 gap fixed (interactive/web items
  now logged, not silently dropped); is_blank() rejects scenes that render
  solid black or near-blank (3D-model dependency, usually); 11 already-blank
  items removed by hand after eye-checking the near-duplicate flags; 1164
  total (1006 live/158 stills); SCENE_RENDERER 9->10
- Personal home server stood up and fully proven: Tailscale + SSH key auth,
  Postgres metadata sync (1164 rows) via tunnel + Keychain password, Caddy
  serving 12.2GB/2611 files verified byte-identical, server sleep bug found
  and fixed. App-side fetch built: WallpaperStore.fetchLibraryVideo mirrors
  AerialCatalog's download shape, checkServerReachable mirrors StatusService,
  wired into WallpaperView's .library case and LibraryTile's messaging.
  Proven with a real delete-then-refetch (SHA-256 identical), not a mock.
  210 tests pass (3 new, stubbed URLProtocol, serialized). Delete-to-free-
  space deliberately not built yet, by agreement.
- Server-fetch feature proven in the real .app, not just swift test - found
  and fixed 3 real bugs invisible to the test suite: async library-load race
  (task never retried), a successful fetch not triggering a redraw
  (observed an ignored property), and App Transport Security silently
  blocking plain HTTP in a real bundle. Also found extracted/+transcoded/
  (70 wallpapers' real playback files, 7.9GB) were missing from the server
  backup entirely - pushed, now complete. Deleted the live desktop
  wallpaper's actual file and watched the running app recover it in ~12s,
  byte-identical. 211 tests pass, 0 warnings.
- Local copies made optional: thumbnails fetchable, offloadAll frees a
  playable file only after the server confirms an identical copy (HEAD +
  Content-Length), "Free Up Space…" in the Library. Real test: 4 files /
  119 MB freed from 3 real wallpapers, one fetched back by the running app
  in ~4s byte-identical. Full-library run left for the user. 216 tests.
- Full-library "Free Up Space" run for real, by explicit go-ahead: freed
  1509 files / 18.7 GiB, verified independently (disk free space, folder
  sizes, catalog/removed.json byte-identical, one freed wallpaper fetched
  back live in ~4s). Found a new real gap in the process: 294 wallpapers
  whose playback file lives under originals/ (never backed up) - the
  safety check correctly kept them rather than deleting unconfirmed
  copies. ~52GB there still has no off-Mac backup. 216 tests, no code
  changes this checkpoint (docs + the real run only).
- Audit findings fixed: retrying/shared/cancellable fetch, importer honours
  offloaded.json, active wallpaper never freed, system still refreshed after a
  late fetch, file work off the main thread. Proven in the real app with the
  server stopped at launch. 224 tests.
- originals/ pushed (280 files, 52.5 GB, verified by name+size) and freed:
  AllSet folder 797 MB, free disk 50 -> 98 GiB; one fetched back live.
- Per-wallpaper download progress bar (Library grid tiles + the desktop
  wallpaper itself): real % while a fetch is under way, replacing a bare
  spinner/nothing. Root cause of the user's "fetch not applying" report:
  clicking several tiles quickly cancels each fetch for the previous one
  (by design - correct), with zero feedback to show it was working at all.
  New WallpaperStore.fetchProgress(for:) is a plain, non-observed read;
  each view polls it on its own 150ms timer only while isFetching(id) is
  true, so redraws stay local to the one downloading tile. Verified against
  the real server: a 68 MB wallpaper landed byte-exact after hitting (and
  correctly recovering from) the async-load race on its first attempt.
  225 tests pass, 0 warnings.
- Library UI: file sizes shown, hover-preview root cause fixed (never
  fetched; now hints "tap to preview"), new bottom-up LibraryDetailSheet,
  Owned filter, two deletes (offload-only vs permanent+admin-gated).
  New server-side delete_service.py (localhost-only, tunnel+token+TouchID).
  deleteEverywhere proven for real: disposable wallpaper with a real DB
  row and server file, deleted, confirmed gone from all four places
  independently. Touch ID prompt itself not self-verified (physical
  limitation). 227 tests.
- Synced local catalog.json from the server's ongoing repair (Postgres ->
  local, raw JSON merge): 358 items repointed to the repair's live/<id>.mp4
  paths, 14 left alone because they still had a local copy (would have
  orphaned it and forced a pointless re-download), 632 already matched.
  Verified for real: fetched one repointed item (557 MB) through the
  actual store - landed byte-exact. It took 8 minutes (server busy
  transcoding), which looked like a stuck retry at first; isolated the
  retry logic outside the UI and confirmed it was never broken, just slow
  - no code change needed. Repair job still running server-side (~1000/1164
  done); re-sync again once it finishes.
- Main-window redesign merged (floating navigation; Library now Desktop → Wallpaper → My Videos); Library features checked present, 239 tests, docs synced — docs only
- Backdrop with drifting blue light, full-bleed heroes (Wallpaper, Themes, Art), theme previews wait while scrolling; scroll/galleryparts probes in CI — `3dc4479`, `928c3fd`
- Widgets (not the library): snap grid, tidy on any layout change, drag to the nearest
  slot with a live preview, gallery drag-to-desktop, right-click menu. 246 tests (7 new,
  all 57 themes keep their shape on the grid). Real app: tidy and Arrange drag landed on
  the predicted slots, menu and Remove work; gallery drop and direct drag await the user.
- Widgets: From Themes in the gallery (623 widgets, 57 themes), per-widget font, letters,
  corners, renamed built-in words (listed from the live preview) and a caption below.
  249 tests. Offscreen renders checked; gallery scroll A/B against the previous commit:
  no change (its hitches predate this, kept for the smoothness step).
- Lid Plane (Jhey's lid-fold effect, GPL) integrated as System → Lid Plane: sensor, safety
  gates, Metal renderer, capture and a settings tab; ported tests + settings tests (259).
  Renderer checks pass and the page renders offscreen with the live 128° reading; live capture
  not yet tried. Also fixed repeated Keychain password prompts (token read at launch).
- AI Screenshot shortcut (Off / ⌘⇧5 / ⌃⌥⌘5): verified in the real app via injected key presses -
  ⌘⇧5 starts the capture alone (system toolbar switched off), quitting restores macOS's
  shortcut. Found that a Carbon hotkey does not stop macOS's own ⌘⇧5, so it is switched off
  and restored. 263 tests.
